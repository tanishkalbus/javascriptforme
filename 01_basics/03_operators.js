// there are some arthimetic operators
//  let a = 7
//  let b = 4

/*
 console.log("a + b = " , a + b );
 console.log("a - b = ", a - b);
 console.log("a *b = ", a * b );
 console.log("a / b = ", a / b );
 console.log("a % b = ", a % b );  // this is called modulus (gives the remainder)
 console.log("a ** b = ", a **b); // this is expotential (a to the power b )
*/

 // now there are soem uniary operators which 
 // increment = a++ which means (a+1) , now there are two types of this also 
 // 1. a++(post increment) = first of all it will do the action and then add 1 to value of a 
 // 2. ++a(pre increment) = first of all it will add the value then perform the action 

 // decrement = a-- which means (a -1) , now there are two types of this also 
 // 1. a--(post decremnt) = first of all it will do the action and then sub 1 to value of a
  // 2. --a(pre decrement) = first of all it will sub the value then perform the action 






  // now there are assignment operators 
// 1. first is the equal to (=)
// 2. += (this means that if a += 4 (a = a + 4 ))
// now therer are -= , *= , /= , %=, **= , (they work same as += )



// comparsion operators  (it always return a boolean value (true,false))
let a = 5;
let b = 3;


console.log("a == b" , a==b);
 // similarly there are !=(not equal to )


 //now there is a special case what happen if we take (a) is equal to "5" and (b) = 5 technically they 
 // both are not the same but js convert string 5 into no then compare so to protect this 
 // we use stricter version of comparsion which is === (it compares both values and their type)
  
 // there are more which are > , < , <= , >= which are basics 



 // LOGICAL OPERATORS 
 // it evalutes multiple expression then returns the answer in boolean 

// something like if the first expression say this is true and second this can be true or not so based 
// based on these it returns a boolean answer 

// They allow you to combine multiple conditions and evaluate them to determine a final boolean result. 
 

// 1. logical and (&&) if the both conditions is true then the final answer is true..
// 2. logical or (||)  if only one condition is true then final answer is true. except both the conditions
// are false 
// 3. logical not (!) it only require one condition and it flips the answer of that means if the answer
// is true then the logical not gives the answer false
