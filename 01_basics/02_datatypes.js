 /* 
there are primtive data types which are 
Numbers: Any number you can think of, whole or with decimals (like 5, 23.7, -100). JavaScript doesn't distinguish between whole numbers and decimals â€“ it treats them all as numbers.
Strings: Collections of characters that represent text. You put strings inside quotation marks (like "Hello world!" or "I'm learning JavaScript").
Booleans: Simple "true" or "false" values, mainly used for representing logical conditions.
Undefined: A variable that has been declared but hasn't been given a value yet. It's like an empty box.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value. It's like saying "There's nothing here on purpose."
this is also a STAND ALONE VALUE 

some are special types 


Special Types

These act a bit differently:

BigInt: Used for storing super-large whole numbers that regular numbers can't handle.
Symbol: A unique value that you can use to create hidden properties on objects. Think of it as a super-secret label.


Complex Data Type

Objects: These are like containers that can hold multiple pieces of data of different types. You can think of an object like a backpack with different compartments to hold different items (numbers, strings, booleans, and even other objects).
