// now the concepts about loops loop - if we want to do some task again and again 
// in syntax of for loop for (){} in (intilization, stopping condition, updation){action for loop}
// we want to print something 15 times 

/*
For loop: Like a recipe with a set number of steps (e.g., bake a cake for 30 minutes).

While loop: Like following instructions until a condition is met (e.g., keep stirring the batter until it's smooth).

Feature	                  For Loop	                                                                       While Loop		
Iterations	    Known beforehand (fixed number of loops)	                      Unknown beforehand (loops based on condition)		
Structure	    for (initialization; condition; increment)	                            while (condition) { code to run }		
Control	         More concise for predetermined loops	                                       More flexible for conditional looping		*/

// now while loop 
// syntax of while loop 
// intilizaiton 
// while (condition){action
//updation}


// next is the do while in which the action will excuted at least one time without looking at the condition and then works exactly same as while loop 

// syntax 
// do {
    // work 
//}  while (condition);
